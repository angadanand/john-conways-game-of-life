Description : This is a simple simulation of John Conways Game of life using his 4 simple rules. 
		The simulation was completed using LWJGL (lwjgl.org). It uses nothing fancy because
		nothing fancy was required. I am currently working on other personal projects but
		in due time I will make a proper UI, a custom mode for adding your own patterns
		and threads to speed up the process.
